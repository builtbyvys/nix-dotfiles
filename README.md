extremely confusing dotfiles that i manage to use because i love this operating system

# setup

you can very quickly get setup (please don't use this) by running the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/builtbyvys/nix-dotfiles.git
cd nix-dotfiles.git
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#my-computer
```
